Subject: Follow-Up and Open Questions from Today's Meeting Regarding LDAP ID:  and Related Processes

I hope this email finds you well. Following up from our meeting today, I am reaching out to share the process we're currently employing, along with a few questions and points of note we've compiled.

Presently, we are utilizing LDAP ID: BIPM01M, which gives us access to production. I have attached some files from the FHF Production region that were loaded today for your reference. The file 'custody-investment-holdings error.csv' comprises the fundID and periodDate (= latestProcessedDate) which returned a 'not found' response from FHF.

At present, we are utilizing LDAP ID: BIPM01M for consumption. This ID provides us with access to production. I have attached some files loaded today from the FHF Production region for your review. Notably, the 'custody-investment-holdings error.csv' file contains fundiD and periodDate (= latestProcessedDate) for which FHF returned a 'not found' response.

Our current process is as follows:

1.We begin by fetching data from the custody-funds API.
2.From this data, we extract fundId and latestProcessingDate.
3.With these parameters, we fetch data from custody-investment-holdings.

As of now, the Custody - Master Data - Portfolio is not integrated into this process.

We have added legalEntity Cid and status to Masterdata-portfolios. Kindly update us if there should be any changes to the order in which APIs are accessed or if there need to be modifications in matching parameters.

Regarding the custody-investment-holdings API, we have several open questions:

When the fund id and periodDate (= latestProcessedDate) are taken from custody-funds, we sometimes receive a 'not found' response for some fundIds from the custody-investment-holdings API. Is this an expected outcome?
We have found fundIds with irrelevant dates. For instance, for fund id = 31, the latestProcessedDate is listed as 01/01/0001, resulting in a 'not found' API response. Could you please review this?
For other APIs, when we encounter any form of failure response, we cease the workflow. The only exception is for the custody-investment-holdings API. Should we continue the workflow if no data is returned for a particular fund id?
Your insights on these matters will be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
